    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        Iowa City's restaurant scene is vibrant and creative, and we love it!
        There simply was not a good website or app for reading or writing reviews specific
        to this scene, until now!
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is in-process. At this point, it is simply a listing of restaurants, however
        soon there will be the ability to write reviews.
